# Xomi JavaScript Secure Application

## Introduction

This is a bare bones JavaScript secure application which can packaged as an AWS lambda or run standalone.

There is a tutorial to show you how to get this application deployed to AWS in a few easy steps on the Xomi developers site:

Alternatively, if you want to get it up and running locally, you will need to integrate it with a Xomi client.
